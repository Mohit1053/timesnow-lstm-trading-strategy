"""
Enhanced LSTM Strategy - Reducing Opposite Predictions
=====================================================

This script implements improvements to reduce the 42.3% opposite predictions
in the original LSTM trading strategy.

Key Improvements:
1. Advanced technical indicators (30+ features)
2. Confidence-based signal filtering (threshold: 0.75)
3. Enhanced model architecture with deeper LSTM
4. Market regime detection
5. Improved target definition with neutral zones
